  "body": "This is a standalone wallet for Android devices which does not depend on any centralized service and gives you full control over your money.\r\n\r\n- It is an [HD wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet) which means your balance and full transaction history can always be restored using a single mnemonic code should anything bad happen to your device. \r\n\r\n- It is intended for mobile devices, hence wallet does not store a full [Block chain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain) but instead acquires all the relevant data from random Bitcoin nodes using an [SPV technique](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/4649/what-is-an-spv-client).\r\n\r\n- It utilizes a nice physical metaphor displaying your bitcoins as a bunch of actual coins that you can interact with. Coins of the same color belong to the same [unspent output](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/4301/what-is-an-unspent-output) and thus provide you with a deep insight into the structure of your money.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mnemonic code\r\n\r\nVisual Bitcoin is an HD wallet, thus all your private keys come from a single mnemonic code which is essentially a phrase comprising of 12 random words. Whoever knows your mnemonic code also fully controls your bitcoins so it should be kept private at all times.\r\n\r\nIdeally one of the following actions should be taken once a new wallet is created:\r\n- Either write your mnemonic code on a piece of paper and store it in a really secure place.\r\n- Or encrypt your mnemonic code using wallet password as a key and store it wherever you like. You can do it using [Secret Space Encryptor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paranoiaworks.unicus.android.sse&hl=en), a popular open source Android app which uses proven cryptography methods for string encryption. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Destruction code\r\n\r\nGood password protects your money from being stolen, but that's about it. In this wallet you can also set a destruction code which can help in preserving your funds even if you are forced to reveal a password. Here is how it works:\r\n\r\n1. First go to Wallet settings and set a destruction code there. Presence of a destruction code will not be indicated anywhere so you will have to remember it was set and exists.\r\n\r\n2. Then check \"Ask for password on startup\" option which is also located in Wallet settings. This will make a password form to appear every time you launch a wallet and that form is the only place where you have a chance to provide a destruction code instead of a real password.\r\n\r\n3. If you enter your destruction code on app launch then your current wallet data will be silently erased and a completely new wallet with a zero balance will be created. Destruction code will become a password for that new wallet. Everything would seem like you have indeed provided a password and your wallet is empty. You will be able to restore your original wallet at a later time using your mnemonic code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bandwidth warning\r\n\r\nAs long as wallet is running it communicates with Bitcoin network and that could be taking up to 2 megabytes per hour. This is not a problem at all for Wi-Fi networks but can be sensitive if you are on a costly cellular data plan. In a latter case make sure you do close a wallet every time after you're done working with it.\r\n\r\nThe concept of shutting down is subtle on Android: if while inside an app you press \"home\" then wallet will be sent hanging in a background for an indefinite time and it will be consuming traffic there. If instead you press \"back\" then wallet will also be sent to background but in a couple of minutes it will really be closed.",
