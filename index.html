      <p>This is a standalone wallet for Android devices which does not depend on any centralized service and gives you full control over your money.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is an <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet">HD wallet</a> which means your balance and full transaction history can always be restored using a single mnemonic code should anything bad happen to your device. </p></li>
<li><p>It is intended for mobile devices, hence wallet does not store a full <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain">Block chain</a> but instead acquires all the relevant data from random Bitcoin nodes using an <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/4649/what-is-an-spv-client">SPV technique</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>It utilizes a nice physical metaphor displaying your bitcoins as a bunch of actual coins that you can interact with. Coins of the same color belong to the same <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/4301/what-is-an-unspent-output">unspent output</a> and thus provide you with a deep insight into the structure of your money.</p></li>
</ul>

<a id="mnemonic-code" class="anchor" href="#mnemonic-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mnemonic code</h3>

<p>Visual Bitcoin is an HD wallet, thus all your private keys come from a single mnemonic code which is essentially a phrase comprising of 12 random words. Whoever knows your mnemonic code also fully controls your bitcoins so it should be kept private at all times.</p>

<p>Ideally one of the following actions should be taken once a new wallet is created:</p>

<ul>
<li>Either write your mnemonic code on a piece of paper and store it in a really secure place.</li>
<li>Or encrypt your mnemonic code using wallet password as a key and store it wherever you like. You can do it using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paranoiaworks.unicus.android.sse&amp;hl=en">Secret Space Encryptor</a>, a popular open source Android app which uses proven cryptography methods for string encryption. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="destruction-code" class="anchor" href="#destruction-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Destruction code</h3>

<p>Good password protects your money from being stolen, but that's about it. In this wallet you can also set a destruction code which can help in preserving your funds even if you are forced to reveal a password. Here is how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First go to Wallet settings and set a destruction code there. Presence of a destruction code will not be indicated anywhere so you will have to remember it was set and exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Then check "Ask for password on startup" option which is also located in Wallet settings. This will make a password form to appear every time you launch a wallet and that form is the only place where you have a chance to provide a destruction code instead of a real password.</p></li>
<li><p>If you enter your destruction code on app launch then your current wallet data will be silently erased and a completely new wallet with a zero balance will be created. Destruction code will become a password for that new wallet. Everything would seem like you have indeed provided a password and your wallet is empty. You will be able to restore your original wallet at a later time using your mnemonic code.</p></li>
</ol>

<a id="bandwidth-warning" class="anchor" href="#bandwidth-warning" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bandwidth warning</h3>

<p>As long as wallet is running it communicates with Bitcoin network and that could be taking up to 2 megabytes per hour. This is not a problem at all for Wi-Fi networks but can be sensitive if you are on a costly cellular data plan. In a latter case make sure you do close a wallet every time after you're done working with it.</p>

<p>The concept of shutting down is subtle on Android: if while inside an app you press "home" then wallet will be sent hanging in a background for an indefinite time and it will be consuming traffic there. If instead you press "back" then wallet will also be sent to background but in a couple of minutes it will really be closed.</p>
